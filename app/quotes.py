"Mathematics is like love; a simple idea, but it can get complicated",

"Mathematics is like checkers in being suitable for the young, not too difficult, amusing, and without peril to the state. -- Plato",

"Mathematics is not a deductive science - that's a cliche. When you try to prove a theorem, you don't just list the hypotheses, and then start to reason. What you do is trial and error, experimentation, guesswork. -- Paul Halmos",

"Mathematics is not only real, but it is the only reality.  -- Martin Gardner",

"Mathematics is often erroneously referred to as the science of common sense.  -- Newman & Kasner",

"Mathematics is the cheapest science. Unlike physics or chemistry, it does not require any expensive equipment. All one needs for mathematics is a pencil and paper.",

"Mathematics Is an Edifice, Not a Toolbox. --Unknown",

"Mathematics is an independent world created out of pure intelligence.  -- William Woods Worth"

"Mathematics is, as it were, a sensuous logic, and relates to philosophy as do the arts, music, and plastic art to poetry. -- K. Shegel",

"Mathematics is a more powerful instrument of knowledge than any other that has been bequeathed to us by human agency.  -- Descartes",

"Mathematics is the science which uses easy words for hard ideas.  -- Edward Kasner and James R. Newman",

"Mathematics is a body of knowledge, but it contains no truths.  -- Morris Kline",

"Mathematics is the science which draws necessary conclusions.  -- Benjamin Pierce",

"Mathematics is an art of human understanding.  -- William Thurston",

"Mathematics, in the common lay view, is a static discipline based on formulas… But outside the public view, mathematics continues to grow at a rapid rate… The guide to this growth is not calculation and formulas, but an open ended search for pattern. -- Lynn A. Steen",

"Mathematics, even in its present and most abstract state, is not detached from life. It is just the ideal handling of the problems of life.- Cassius Jackson Keyser",

"Mathematics is the science of definiteness, the necessary vocabulary of those who know.  -- W. J. White",

"Mathematics compares the most diverse phenomena and discovers the secret analogies that unite them.  -- Joseph Fourier",

"Mathematics is on the artistic side a creation of new rhythms, orders, designs, harmonies, and on the knowledge side, is a systematic study of various rhythms, orders. -- William L. Schaaf",

"Mathematics is not just another language . . . it is a language plus logic. Mathematics is a tool for reasoning.  -- Richard Feynman",

"Mathematics is not a contemplative but a creative subject; no one can draw much consolation from it when he has lost the power or the desire to create; and that is apt to happen to a mathematician rather soon. It is a pity, but in that case he does not matter a great deal anyhow, and it would be silly to bother about him.  -- G.H. Hardy",

"Mathematics, however, is, as it were, its own explanation; this, although it may seem hard to accept, is nevertheless true, for the recognition that a fact is so is the cause upon which we base the proof.  -- Girolamo Cardano",

"Mathematics makes a nice distinction between the usually synonymous terms 'elementary' and 'simple', with 'elementary' taken to mean that not very much mathematical knowledge is needed to read the work and 'simple' to mean that not very much mathematical ability is needed to understand it. -- Julian Havel",

"Mathematics is a hard thing to love. It has the unfortunate habit, like a rude dog, of turning its most unfavourable side towards you when you frst make contact with it.  -- David Whiteland"
